# Simple-Handpose-Image-Editor
using p5.js and handpose model from ml5.js

As the name suggests, this has EXTREMELY limited features when compared to normal image editors ;)

And it is actually an assignment from a bachelor-level HCI course ;) 

~~(source code will be available later)~~

# Features
This program allows user to perform actions by switching to 3 different modes:
1. Default Mode
   For view only. User's index fingertip is still detected but no actions will be performed on the image.
2. Freehand Drawing Mode
   Users can draw on the image by moving their finger.
3. Region Selection and Copying Mode
   Users can copy the selected region of the image and place it on the another selected region of the image.

(And sadly these are the only functions can be done by this program :( )
